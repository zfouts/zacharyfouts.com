February 2019 I took a business trip to meet the global team at our company, we had folks from Canada, United Kingdom, and of course Japan (plus myself from the USA). We spent two weeks planning out what we’re working on for all of 2019.

# Exploration
Of course, during my downtime (evenings, weekends) I had to go explore. I took several photos - Find them Here, visited several stores, did some tourist things.

I got to see my old friend Toshi – He runs an AirBNB Experience (Tsukiji (Old) vs Toyosu (New) S.S Tour that I did last year, he invited me to take a free tour over to Toyosu! So I had to of course! This guy is an absolute great tour guide and I HIGHLY suggest taking the tour if you’re over there. Tell him Texas Zachary-San sent you :-)

He takes you places you’re not supposed to see as a tourist, and then feeds you a fantastic kaiseki dinner/lunch. Sushi, Sasahmi, and whatever else you request while at the markets! My lunch had everything from Tuna, to Tako (Octopus). He invited me back for lunch on this trip, but I had to politely decline :-(.

## Places Visted:
1. Ikebukuro (Tokyu Hands, Pokemon Store, Super Potato, Bic Camera)
2. Harajuku (SMOKEHOUSE)
3. Shinjuku (Tokyu Hands, Donki)
4. Roppongi (Tokyu Hands, Donki, Misc Food)
5. Ginza (Godzilla Statue, Misc Food)
6. Tsukiji (Outer Market, Daiso, Misc Food)
7. Toyosu (Fish Market)
8. Kanda (Misc Food)
9. Akihabara (Super Potato, Trader, Gachopon Hall, Hard Off/Book Off, Misc Food)
10. Asakusa (Donki, Misc Food, Kitchen Street)
11. Ueno (Ameyoko Market, Misc Food)
12. Imperial Palace (Statue of Kusunoki Masashige)
13. Yurakucho (Misc Food, Bic Camera)

# Food, where do I even begin?
I had EVERYTHING anyone could ever possibly want. Fish, Whale, Horse, Chicken, Pig, you name the animal (aside from common household pets) and I probably had it on this trip.

## New Food:
1. Omurice (not a fan)
2. Okonomiyaki (Good when not entirely covered with green onion)
3. Kamaboko (Delicious)
4. Gyukatsu (Amazing)
5. A5 Wagyu T-Bone (Life changing)

# Meeting Mr. Texas
One of my biggest highlights was meeting my Instagram friend, Tekeshi (T’s Diner, aka Mr. Texas). Being that I live in Texas and now consider myself a “Texan”, I had to meet this guy! He’s awesome! I loved hanging out with him, and will happily show him around Texas if he ever makes the trip.ImgurImgurImgur

# Hotel Fire!
My last night in Tokyo we had a bit of a scare at my hotel that involved fire trucks and exiting my hotel (I was on the 10th floor). The 3rd floor had a small fire, but ultimately it wasn’t a big deal.

I wasn’t about to listen to their orders that were _Stay In Your Room_ primarily because they first went on the intercom in what appeared to be very paniced Japanese (even Google Translate couldn’t pick it up). I left my room, cause I’m not about to be on the top floor of a potentially burning building.


# Shopping
I bought several Retro Gaming items – Primarily a Super Famicom and about 15 games. Additionally I bought the Super Famicom Classic (you know, like the NES/SNES Classic?). Also bought a Nintendo Family Computer Disk System strictly for the case. It holds a Raspberry Pi without a problem, may turn it into a small form factor PC for gaming? We’ll see!

## New Favorite Stores (no particular order):
Super Potato – Retro gaming to the extreme
Tokyu Hands – It’s a great DIY store where you can buy wood, leather, etc. I bought both :)
Don Quijote (Donki) – They have everything you can think of too.
Daiso – the dollar general of Japan. Except…it’s not total trash.
Really excited to see what else is in store for 2019!
